<h1>CXR Radiology Analysis and Diagnosis System</h1>

<p>This AI system is designed to search and identify symptoms from CXR input following a human radiologist methodology</p>
<p>The system consisted of 3 AI, one for getting segmentation of chest organs, one for searching for nodules that are prevalent in tuberculosis viral pneumonia and cancer patient, and one for classifying the lungs based on it's color and it's size.</p>
<p>The system can identify the existence of cardiomegaly, Tuberculosis, Viral Pneumonia, Bacterial Pneumnia, COVID-19 disease (seperated from viral pneumonia family), Tumors, and abnormalities that may exist in the CXR</p>
<p>To use the system:
  1. Simply clone the repository to local drive, </br>
  2. Unzip the 3 zipped file to current directory on the /AIs/NoduleV3/weights/ </br>
  3. Then open the "finalUser.py" file and change the input image,</br>
  4. Then run the python code.</p>
